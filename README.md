## Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your machine: Java Development Kit (JDK): Download here https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/

Use online gdb to run all the files https://www.onlinegdb.com/

Download the inttelij sowfware from the link given below https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/?section=windows

## Input
Enter which algorithm to apply and used to run prims or kruskal's algorithm

## Output
Gives the minimum distance to travel between the edges of the cities.

## Input
We give distance matrix and weather data as the input for the code

## Output
we get the visualization map between all the cities which includes the distance and weather

## Steps

- Extract all the files in the project.
- After creating the project, add code to the main.java file and rename the file as CityGraph1.java
- To include the library files, follow this path:  file>project sturucture>modules>dependencies>libraries
- Update the paths of the weather data and distance matrix in your computer
- Run CityGraph1.java
- We get the visualization map as the output.
  
## Example
- In file CityGraph1.java, to include library files image
